### ðŸš€ Firebase Project Setup

#### 1. Create Firebase Project

- Visit [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- Create a new project (e.g. `flutter_video_feed`)
- Add platforms (Android/iOS/Web)

#### 2. Enable Firebase Services

- **Authentication** â†’ Enable **Anonymous** and **Email/Password**
- **Firestore Database** â†’ Create DB (test mode for dev)
- **Storage** â†’ Get Started (test mode)

#### 3. Configure Firebase with FlutterFire

Run this command in the project root:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### ðŸŽ¥ Seed Firestore with Initial Videos

Since the app currently does **not include a video upload functionality**, you can **manually seed the Firestore database** with sample videos using a provided script.

To seed the database, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
flutter run -t tool/upload_initial_videos.dart
